   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following traits define an item `_bitfield_extract_primitive`, perhaps you need to implement one of them:
           candidate #1: `BitFieldExtractionSigned`
           candidate #2: `BitFieldExtractionUnsigned`
